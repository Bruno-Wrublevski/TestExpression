# TestExpression

My approach was to divide it into 3 projects:
1) Expression value get API;
2) Project where the business logic is located;
3) UnitTest project;

I used this approach to respect the SOLID principles of Single Responsibility Principle and Interface Segregation Principle.

As it is a simple project, I did not implement any other design patterns.
